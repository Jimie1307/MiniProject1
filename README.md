# MiniProject1
A mini project for my Web Engineering course!

## Introduction
<br> This involves all the files I wrote to build my own blogging site from scratch using PHP in majority. 
<br> All the functions/features are needed for the assignment. I will maybe try to redo it so that it can be viewed online. 
<br> Done using Notepad++ and XAMPP.
<br> A report is included which shows all the pages/functions in the website. </br>
